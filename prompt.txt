# F1 Race Prediction Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict Formula 1 race outcomes using historical and practice session data, leveraging the `fastf1` library to fetch data and a custom pipeline to process, analyze, and predict results. The pipeline includes loading practice data, cleaning and aggregating it, computing driver performance metrics (e.g., BasePace, DegradationSlope), analyzing sandbagging, evaluating track evolution, analyzing track characteristics, predicting race outcomes, and comparing predictions with actual results using a SQLite database (`f1_fantasy.db`). The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook (`F1_Analysis4.ipynb`) with 14 cells, each representing a step in the pipeline.

## Current Status
As of March 19, 2025, the project has made significant progress:

- **Cell 5(Unified Driver Performance Analysis)**: Made successful amendments to improve the prediction of the degradation slope
- **Cell 12 (Batch Processing)**: Successfully resolved the `TypeError: load_existing_practice_data() got an unexpected keyword argument 'force_redownload'` by updating Cell 4 to include the `force_redownload` parameter. Cell 12 now runs for Rounds 1-7, but Rounds 8 and 9 are missing due to an incomplete schedule fetched by `fastf1` (only 15 events instead of 24).
- **Cells 13 and 14 (Prediction Comparison)**: Enhanced to provide detailed breakdowns of prediction errors (by driver and race) and to correlate errors with analysis inputs (e.g., BasePace, DegradationSlope). Added visualizations to identify trends in prediction accuracy.
- **Workflow**: Refined the workflow to leverage Cells 13 and 14 for comparing predictions with actuals, identifying discrepancies, tracing errors back to analysis components (Cells 5-9), and iteratively improving the model.

## Next Steps
1. **Complete Cell 12 Execution**:
   - Confirm that Cell 12 processes all rounds (1-9) successfully with the updated Cells 2 and 4.
   - Verify that Rounds 8 and 9 are processed using the manual schedule fallback.
   - Make any fixes to ensure it runs successfully
   - Share the full output, including `LapTime` and sector time logging, to ensure time conversions are working correctly.

2. **Run Cells 13 and 14**:
   - Run Cells 13 and 14 to compare predictions with actuals for Rounds 1-9.
   - Share the outputs to evaluate prediction accuracy and identify discrepancies.

3. **Analyze Discrepancies**:
   - Use the outputs of Cells 13 and 14 to identify the largest prediction errors (e.g., drivers with high points errors, races with high position errors).
   - Trace these errors back to analysis components (Cells 5-9) using the correlations and visualizations in Cell 14.

4. **Refine the Analysis**:
   - Update the relevant cells (e.g., Cell 5 for `DegradationSlope`, Cell 7 for sandbagging) based on the discrepancies.
   - We can take each step/cell and run it step by step and I can share the output so we can see how we can improve it.
   - Only try to refine the existing code and do not rewrite the logic unless you ask me whether you should complete rewrite the logic
   - Examples:
     - If `BasePace` is overestimated, refine the long-run lap selection in Cell 5.
     - If sandbagging is missed, enhance detection in Cell 7.
     - If track characteristics are inaccurate, update Cell 9 with historical data.

5. **Re-Run and Validate**:
   - Re-run the pipeline (Cells 1-12) and Cells 13-14 to validate the improvements.
   - Compare the new prediction errors with the previous ones to confirm improvement.

6. **Document and Iterate**:
   - Document findings in a report, summarizing discrepancies, changes made, and impact on prediction accuracy.
   - Plan further refinements, such as incorporating pit stop strategies, weather impacts, or DNF probabilities.

## Prompt for Collaboration
We are working on a Formula 1 race prediction project using the `fastf1` library in a Jupyter Notebook (`F1_Analysis4.ipynb`). The pipeline includes loading practice data (Cell 4), computing driver performance metrics (Cell 5), analyzing sandbagging (Cell 7), evaluating track evolution (Cell 8), analyzing track characteristics (Cell 9), predicting race outcomes (Cell 10), batch processing multiple rounds (Cell 12), and comparing predictions with actuals (Cells 13 and 14). We currently have an error on Step 12 relating to `force_redownload` error in Cell 12.

**Current Tasks**:
- Confirm that Cell 12 processes Rounds 1-9 successfully, and make the necessary corrections to fix it.  Ask me to share the current output if that helps.
- Run Cells 13 and 14 to compare predictions with actuals and identify discrepancies.
- Trace prediction errors back to analysis components (Cells 5-9) and refine the model.
- Document findings and iterate on the analysis.

**Please Provide**:
- The full output of Cell 12, including `LapTime` and sector time logging, to confirm that Rounds 8 and 9 are processed and time conversions are correct.
- The outputs of Cells 13 and 14 to evaluate prediction accuracy and identify discrepancies.
- Any issues or observations during execution.

**Focus Areas**:
- Ensure all rounds are processed correctly in Cell 12.
- Identify the largest prediction errors using Cells 13 and 14.
- Trace errors back to specific analysis components (e.g., BasePace, DegradationSlope, sandbagging) and suggest improvements.
- Refine the workflow for iterative improvement of the prediction model.
